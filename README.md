## Problem Statement
The United States is home to the world’s most premier men’s professional basketball league, the National Basketball Association(NBA), one of North America’s major professional sports leagues. One of these popular teams in the NBA is the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers are planning on creating a team better than the “1971–72 team” by buying some of the best players in the league this season to win the championship. They want to do so by getting the players they are eyeing based on player rating and budget. The Lakers analytics team is trying to find a way to get the best combination of player-to-budget ratio such that they get sign-and-trade deals to maximize the overall pick rating with the current budget of 105k.
